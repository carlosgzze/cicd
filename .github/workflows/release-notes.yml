   pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Getting information of pull request
      - name: Getting PR number
        run: echo We use the global workflow variable $BUILD_CONFIGURATION
      
      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Getting PR information

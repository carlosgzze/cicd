## This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
   pull_request:
    branches: [master]
    types: [closed]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  build:
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      # Getting Pr information from the commit SHA
      - name: Getting PR information
        run: |
          sudo apt update
          sudo apt install jq -y
          bash
          export pr_number=`git show ${{ github.sha }} | sed -n -e 's/^.*Merge pull request #//p' | sed -n -e 's/from.*$//p' | sed 's/ //g'`
          releasenotes=$(curl "https://api.github.com/repos/carlosgzze/cicd/pulls/$pr_number" | jq '.body' | sed -e 's/\\r\\n/ /g' | sed -n -e 's/^.*### Release Notes //p' | sed -n -e 's/### Reviewers.*$//p')
